/*--------1 Month----------*/

/*

=>Solved around 90 problems mostly 800

=>7 Contests ==> solved 0

=>Learnings:
>Problem solving,implementation,bruteforce,greedy,maths,writing code,thinking..
>DSA-STL,vectors,maps,sets,gcd,arrays,sorting/searching,dsu
>Errors-Overflow,TLE,RTE
>Time Complexity-Constraints,Edge Cases

=>Areas of improvements:

>Keeping calm & Solving during contests
>Understanding question-Focusing on edge cases,constraints
>Implementing,Designing efficient solution
>Solving more problems during virtual contests
